Example Configuration
---------------------

Here's an example of a configuration file that uses the ``eks`` runtime and the ``local`` secret store. This configuration sets up Hydroplane to talk to an EKS cluster named ``my-cool-cluster`` in the ``us-west-2`` AWS region:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    secret_store:
      secret_store_type: local
      store_location: ~/.hydro_secrets

    runtime:
      runtime_type: eks
      cluster_name: my-cool-cluster
      region: us-west-2
      credentials:
        access_key:
          access_key_id:
            secret_name: aws-credentials
            key: AccessKeyId
          secret_access_key:
            secret_name: aws-credentials
            key: SecretAccessKey


Quickstart
----------

Step 1: Create an EKS cluster and IAM user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to use the ``eks`` runtime, you first have to have an EKS cluster. We'll use `hydro-project/eks-setup <https://github.com/hydro-project/eks-setup>`_ to do that. Follow the instructions in the "Quickstart" section of that repo's README and then come back here.

When you're done with those instructions, you should have two things:

* An EKS cluster (we'll assume that the cluster's name is ``hydro-eks`` and that it was created in ``us-west-2`` in subsequent steps for brevity)
* The access key and secret key for a user in the cluster's ``cluster-admins`` group (if you added a user using ``eks-setup user add``, that user is in the ``cluster-admins`` group)


Step 2: Configure Hydroplane
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a file named ``eks.yml`` with the following contents:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    secret_store:
      secret_store_type: local
      store_location: ~/.hydro_secrets

    runtime:
      runtime_type: eks
      cluster_name: hydro-eks
      region: us-west-2
      credentials:
        access_key:
          access_key_id:
            secret_name: aws-credentials
            key: AccessKeyId
          secret_access_key:
            secret_name: aws-credentials
            key: SecretAccessKey


If you haven't already, initialize your local secret store:

.. code-block:: bash

    bin/local-secret-store init


Make a note of the password you used when configuring the store; you'll need it when Hydroplane starts.

Now, create a file called ``creds.json`` that looks like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {"AccessKeyId":"<put your user's access key ID here>","SecretAccessKey":"<put your user's secret access key here>"}

Add that file to the secret store:

.. code-block:: bash

    bin/local-secret-store add -f creds.json aws-credentials


and delete the plaintext original afterwards:

.. code-block:: bash

    rm creds.json


Step 3: Run Hydroplane
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now you've (finally) got an EKS cluster and the ability to authenticate to it! Let's launch Hydroplane:

.. code-block:: bash

    bin/hydroplane -c eks.yml

You'll be prompted for the password to your local secret store. Once you enter it, the server should bind and start accepting requests.

In a separate terminal, from the root of the ``hydroplane`` repo, let's make sure we can list processes:

.. code-block:: bash

   bin/hpctl list

You should get back an empty list, because we haven't launched any processes yet.

Let's try a simple example to make sure we can start something and access it remotely:

.. code-block:: bash

   bin/hpctl start examples/nginx.json

If you list processes with ``bin/hpctl list`` now, you should see something like this:

.. code-block:: json

    [
      {
        "process_name": "nginx",
        "group": null,
        "socket_addresses": [
          {
            "host": "34.217.208.197",
            "port": 31491,
            "is_public": true
          }
        ],
        "created": "2022-12-01T22:40:33+00:00",
        "status": "RUNNING"
      }
    ]

Note that the process is exposing a single public port. In this example, it's ``34.217.208.197:31491``, but your host and port will be different.

If you have ``jq`` installed, are on macOS, and want to open that server with a one-liner:

.. code-block:: bash

    open http://$(bin/hpctl list | jq -r "(.[0].socket_addresses[0].host + \":\" + (.[0].socket_addresses[0].port|tostring))")

Otherwise, you can copy-paste the host and port into a browser window. Either way, you should see an `nginx <https://www.nginx.com/>`_ "hello world" page.

Now that we've verified that everything is working, let's stop the process:

.. code-block:: bash

    bin/hpctl stop nginx


Implementation and Configuration Details
----------------------------------------

For details on how the ``eks`` runtime creates processes, see :doc:`/architecture/k8s`.

Authenticating with AWS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for Hydroplane to launch processes on an EKS cluster, it must be able to authenticate with that cluster. To authenticate, you'll need an AWS `access key ID and corresponding secret access key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html>`_. These credentials will need to be stored in Hydroplane's :doc:`secret store </secrets>`.

.. _eks-secret-example:

Authenticating with IAM Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's an example configuration that uses a secret stored in Hydroplane's secret store to authenticate with EKS. This config uses a secret named ``aws-creds`` that's stored in the secret store as a JSON object like so:

.. code-block:: json

    {"AccessKeyId":"XXXXXXXXX","SecretAccessKey":"XXXXXXX"}

These related credentials are referenced individually using the ``key`` field.

.. code-block:: yaml

    runtime:
        runtime_type: eks
        cluster_name: my-cluster
        region: us-west-2
        credentials:
          access_key:
            access_key_id:
              secret_name: aws-creds
              key: AccessKeyId
            secret_access_key:
              secret_name: aws-creds
              key: SecretAccessKey

Authenticating with Role Assumption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While nothing stops you from authenticating directly with an access key and secret, it's generally considered a best practice to authenticate using `temporary IAM credentials <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html#using-temp-creds-sdk-cli>`_. These credentials are associated with a given IAM role, and expire after a certain period of time. Hydroplane will attempt to automatically renew these temporary credentials periodically.

Here's an example of using the ``aws-creds`` secret from above to authenticate and then assume the role ``EKSAdmin``. Most of this configuration will look familiar if you've looked at the configuration in the last section, but we've added an ``assume_role`` block to define the role assumption.

.. code-block:: yaml

    runtime:
        runtime_type: eks
        cluster_name: my-cluster
        region: us-west-2
        credentials:
          access_key:
            access_key_id:
              secret_name: aws-creds
              key: AccessKeyId
            secret_access_key:
              secret_name: aws-creds
              key: SecretAccessKey
           assume_role:
             role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/EKSAdmin"


A Note on IAM User Permissions
------------------------------

The authenticating IAM user must have enough permissions on the EKS cluster to create and destroy pods and services. If you've set up your cluster with `hydro-project/eks-setup <https://github.com/hydro-project/eks-setup>`_, then any user you add using that script will have the appropriate privileges.
